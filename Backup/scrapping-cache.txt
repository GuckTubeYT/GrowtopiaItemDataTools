3156|Transdimensional Vaporizer Ray|This is a highly advanced alien device with one purpose: it can fire right through solid matter to vaporize background without doing any harm to the foreground blocks. It uses alien batteries which we can't replace, so each Vaporizer can only be used once.
3158|Carnival Pinwheel|Enjoy the beauty of this spinny pinwheel!
3160|Sword And Shield|This is a classic warrior's combo - a nice cutlass for your main hand, and a shield in the other. This shield makes you harder to knock back!
3162|Twin Swords|Why waste time with a shield? Just get two swords!
3164|Preppy Blonde Hair|I think you've got just enough gel in there to go to the sock hop with Buffy!
3166|Pet Slime|Nothing cuter than a sentient ball of slime that follows you around!
3168|Strawberry Slime|So much tastier than mucus flavor!
3170|Angry Unicorn Block|This block is angry, and prominently features a unicorn.
3172|Legal Briefs|Not only are these comfortable undergarments for everyday use, they also have a legal use: put them on when you are in trouble for Malpractice, and you'll be freed from your punishment! This uses up the Briefs.
3174|Ring Of Smithing|To be honest, this ring doesn't really do anything. Well, that is unless you want to smith something. Then you're definitely gonna need to wear this!
3176|Anvil|You can forge astounding weapons on this, if it's next to a Forge that's been heated to 1,000 degrees, and you have Smithing Tools, and wear a Ring of Smithing and a Blacksmith's Apron. Oh, and have some item you want to smith. If you've got all that, go ahead and use the item on the anvil!
3178|Blacksmith's Apron|This apron is made of heavy leather, making it very effective for protecting you from stray sparks when forging things.
3180|Crystal Smithing Tools|These tools are so gentle they break after 1 use! Use them wisely!
3182|Blade Fragment|This is a broken piece of a sword blade. It's of a low-quality steel and could stand to be tempered.
3184|Shield Fragment|This is a broken piece of a shield. If you had enough of these, you could probably forge them into a new shield!
3186|Tempered Steel Fragment|This is a beautiful steel fragment of a sword blade. If you had enough of these, you could probably forge them into a new sword blade!
3188|Sword Pommel|This is a lovingly crafted sword pommel. If only there were a blade to attach it to!
3190|Sword Blade|This is a lovingly crafted sword blade. If only there were a pommel to attach it to!
3192|Warrior's Shield|This is a loving crafted shield. But you can't punch block with a shield. Maybe you can combine this with a weapon to make a complete set?
3194|Forge|You can use this to forge astounding weapons, if you have an Anvil next to it. You'll also need to fuel it with something really hot.
3196|Nuclear Fuel|You can feel your cells mutating just being near this lump of radioactive garbage. About the only thing this is good for is firing up a forge to ridiculous levels of heat.
3198|Gift of the Unicorn|The unicorn has gifted you great wisdom! The wisdom is thus: If you stick this wisdom, 2 Sword Pommels, and 2 Sword Blades, into a Laboratory and SCIENCE them... well, let's just say it'll be super cool.
3200|Giving Tree|"Borrowed" from the Growch's private reserve, this magnificent tree will give you a gift every 4 hours for the duration of Winterfest!
3202|Giving Tree Stump|This will regrow into a Giving Tree in a while.
3204|Tree Decorations|All sorts of baubles and gewgaws to adorn your Giving Tree in true Winterfest style! One decoration won't do much, but you can toss up to 100 decorations on each tree! More decorations will logically result in better gifts, but taking the gift will remove all the decorations with it!
3206|Lumber Axe|This axe is precisely balanced to chop down trees in just a single hit! Now, you might not be impressed since you can do that with your bare hands already. But wait - this axe can chop down the GROWCH'S trees! Of course, doing that will shatter it. They're very special trees.
3208|Axe Fragment|This is a broken piece of an axe blade. It's not very high quality, perhaps it could be tempered.
3210|Icy Heart Of Winter|You've found the Growch's icy heart! No wonder he's so mean - it's not even in his body! That's a major medical problem that would upset anyone.
3212|Icy Heart Pickup|Players pick up an Icy Heart of Winter by touching this.
3214|Axe Of Winter|Mittens are recommended when wielding this icy monstrosity, which does extra damage to blocks.
3216|Moose Cap|This beautifully styled hat, suitable for all formal occasions, has the unique property of attracting wild meese to follow you around.
3218|Candy Cane Bait|This is a bait for fishing. Equip a fishing rod and then use this bait on water that you are standing next to in order to start fishing. This is the only bait that is its own hook! It catches unique seasonal fish that other bait doesn't appeal to.
3220|Neon Squid|This is a 1 lb. Neon Squid. This squid glows in neon colors! What a fine holiday gift it would make.
3222|Antarctic Icefish|This is a 1 lb. Antarctic Icefish. These fish have the ability to survive in Antarctic waters because they actually have antifreeze in their blood! Its science, google it.
3224|Gingerbread Fish|This is a 1 lb. Gingerbread Fish. You know how you can dunk cookies in milk? This one was dunked in the ocean. Kinda gross.
3226|Swedish Fish|This is a 1 lb. Swedish Fish. This breed of fish is unique to the waters of Sweden, and it has a surprisingly sweet taste when eaten raw. Don't eat yours though, it's a pet.
3228|Snowcone|Yum, fruit flavors poured into ice! At least it's yum until all the flavoring gets sucked out.
3230|Toboggan|This sled was called "Onion Bulb" by its original owner, but you can call it whatever you want. It comes with a free purple blanket to keep your legs warm!
3232|Winter Wind|Place this anywhere you want the wind to come ripping through and push players around! The wind blows in the direction that you would blow air when placing it, so you can place it either way.
3234|Snowflake Block|Just one exceptionally large snowflake, perfectly preserved in lucite. I don't know how they did it, but it's nice and slippery!
3236|Winter Robe|Be the King of Winter in this luxurious satiny robe! Note: this is a "chest item", like a necklace, so you can wear any shirts and back items you want underneath it.
3238|Magical Carrot|With just a touch of winter magic, it's really not that hard to bring a snowman to life. I don't know why more people don't do it!
3240|Hot Chocolate|Mmm, sweet and toasty, with marshmallows! This not only warms your insides, but it also contains a massive dose of delicious iodine to clear out any radiation you're currently suffering from. Inexplicably it also charges up Geiger Counters when consumed. I can't explain that one.
3242|Tempered Axe Fragment|This is a broken piece of an axe blade, tempered to polished steel! With enough of these, and a suitable source of enraged winter fury, you could forge an amazing Icy Axe Blade.
3244|Icy Axe Blade|This blade is enchanted with winter magic! You could build an awesome weapon with a pair of these and a handle... well, it'd be awesome if you could hold it. Maybe you need something to protect your hands when holding it.
3246|Steel Axe Handle|This thing has a nice heft, and handy notches for inserting up to two axe blades. The only real downside is that it's made entirely of metal, so if you were to place, say, magical ice blades in it, the cold would be transmitted right to your hand, and you wouldn't be able to hold it.
3248|Grip Tape|This is handy for wrapping around the handle of a weapon or tool. It can improve your grip, as well as protect you from cold metal handles.
3250|Riding Winter Wolf|It's just like a horse... except soft and fuzzy!
3252|Weather Machine - Snowy Night|Man, the weather outside is frightful! And dark!
3254|Elf Stockings|This is just really long underwear. You probably should wear pants over them, but hey, Growtopia doesn't support that, so you'll just have to be cold!
3256|Sock On The Wall|You'll need to wash your socks. This one stuck to the wall!
3258|Steam Gear|This is a cog in a vast steam machine. Or can it be, if you build one, with this in it! This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power.
3260|Steam Tubes|Tubes for directing steam power. This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. Steam flows straight when possible, otherwise it turns right (and turns left if it can't do that!)
3262|Steam Piston|Steam power makes it go whump whump whump. This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power.
3264|Steam Lifter Piston|Steam power makes it go whump whump whump up and down. This links up to other steam blocks and can conduct steam power.
3266|Steam Bellows|Steam power makes it go eenk-oonk-eenk (pardon the technical terminology). This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power.

3270|Steam Stomper|Jump on this to shoot steam below it! Use the other Steam Blocks to direct the steam when you need it.
3272|Growtopia Fan Shirt|This amazing psychic shirt can actually display your thought with spectacular new morphing Ink technology. Note: Yeah, it just says the one thing, but you know you're thinking it.
3274|T-Shirt Cannon|Powered by a Fuel Pack on your back, this gun can launch free T-shirts at your fellow Growtopians! Don't waste shots at anything else, it still burns fuel!
3276|Ghost Fan Shirt|You like ghosts? No? Sure looks like you do.
3278|Pineapple Fan Shirt|Who doesn’t pineapple GT?
3280|Steam Valve|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. If steam enters this block from the top or bottom, it will go out the bigger side, and the valve will flip for the next time.
3282|Steam Organ|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. When steam passes through this block, it plays a beautiful music! Use your wrench to adjust what note comes out.
3284|Steam Vent|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. When steam passes through this block, it vents some out with intense heat! Do not touch this for 3 seconds after steam has been through.
3286|Steam Door|Punch it to open it or shut it. But even if you don't have access to do that, you can still open and shut it with steam power!
3288|Steampunk Corset|Tired of always choosing the survival of your internal organs over looking skinny? The corset is the thing for you!
3290|Steampunk Skirt|Multiple layers of petticoats keep you warm!
3292|Steampunk Top Hat|Keep an extra pair of googles up there. You never know when you'll need them.
3294|Steampunk Waistcoat|This perfect garment for housing a pocketwatch, monocle, and perhaps taxidermy needles. Definitely some weird stuff in those pockets.
3296|Steampunk Leggings|Works equally well for a steampunk or a pirate! Or maybe a dancer from the 80’s.
3298|Steampunk Trenchcoat|Keep warm on those frosty London evenings in this stylish piece by Grow Couture! Note: this is a “Chest item”, like a necklace so you can wear any shirts and back items you want underneath it.
3300|Party Blaster|Take the party with you everywhere you go!
3302|Tempered Party Tunes|This is a highly polished bit of music. So shiny! Enough of these might be able to forge a relic from ancient times past...
3304|80's Tape Deck|Wow, this is some seriously old technology. It's no good without a suitable power source and some speakers to rock out of.
3306|D Battery|A portable source of a tiny amount of power.
3308|ERROR!|No info.
3310|Steampunk Sprocket|There's not a lot of difference between a sprocket and a gear. But this is a sprocket.
3312|Steampunk Gearbox|It's a box full of sprockets and gears and whatnots! It's probably part of an awesome steampunk creation.
3314|Stretched Canvas|It's not the prettiest decoration for your world, but it's probably got some other good uses.
3316|Silkworm|A cute little pet for you to feed and care for! They'll eat almost anything, but don't forget to give them water too. Use your wrench to change your pet's name.

3558|Steam Engine|Feed Nuclear Fuel to heat this above 500 degrees, and it will generate steam toward the left or right (depending on how it's placed)! Use the other Steam Blocks to direct the steam where you need it. This is a steam generator.
3560|Lock Mover|Use this fabulous device anywhere in a world you have world-locked to move the World Lock to a new location. There must be an empty space where you tap for this to work.
3562|Cave Blast|This devastating bomb will create a brand new underground cave world, full of darkness and creepy surprises!
3564|Cave Dirt|Yep, it's dirt. In a cave.
3566|Cave Column|Cave Dirt hooks into this like it's got Block Glue on it, so you can build seamless caverns. These are just fun pillars to hide behind in a cave!
3568|Stalagmite|These dangerous spikes grow from the GROUND (StalaGmite!) as water drips down and accumulates minerals. Cave Dirt will blend into them seamlessly.
3570|Stalactite|These dangerous spikes grow from the CEILING (stalaCtite!) as water deposits minerals on its way to dripping down. Cave Dirt will blend into them seamlessly.
3572|Cave Platform|Handy rock platforms. These connect seamlessly to Cave Dirt and can sit atop Cave Columns as well.
3574|Spelunker's Headlamp|This hardhat protects you from falling rocks, while the headlamp lights up the dark caverns.
3576|Night Vision Goggles|Equipping this lets you disregard darkness completely! If you're not in a world you own, they consume 1 D Battery for every minute you wear them. You can wear them without a battery if you just want to look cool, though.
3578|Hand Torch|British people would call this a flashlight, but this is an actual torch, for your hand. As opposed to an Adventure Item or wall torch. Carrying this lights up dark caves. Torches burn out at unpredictable moments, so carry several.
3580|Purple Cave Crystal|These crystals grow naturally in caves. They don't actually glow - bioluminescent organisms feed on them and emit light. Also heat - be careful!
3582|Golden Cave Crystal|These crystals grow naturally in caves. They don't actually glow - bioluminescent organisms feed on them and emit light. Also heat - be careful!
3584|Aqua Cave Crystal|These crystals grow naturally in caves. They don't actually glow - bioluminescent organisms feed on them and emit light. Also heat - be careful!

3590|Climbing Boots|These handy boots allow you to climb Climbing Walls. Just jump and hold the arrow towards the wall!

3606|Topaz Block|Flawlessly cut by our master gemologists, enjoy this transcendent jewel, an heirloom to last a lifetime.
3608|Deep Iron|Mine this to forge stuff out of Deep Iron.
3610|Deep Iron Ore|This is raw ore, mined from the deep within the Earth. Surely there's something you can do with it!
3612|Deep Iron Ingot|You've managed to process this ore into a pure, shining ingot, just by tossing it into a fire!
3614|Pick Blade|This pick blade is forged from Deep Iron, which makes it particularly attuned to pickin’ real darn good.
3616|Guardian Pineapple|When activated (punch to activate), this jealous pineapple prevents anyone from using Consumable items in your world.
3618|Pineapple Ring|Watch out, these are really slippery to stand on!
3620|Pineapple Fish|This is a 1 lb. Pineapple Fish. This SHOULD be known as Hawaii's state fish!
3622|Pineapple Daiquiri|Mmm, this non-alcoholic cocktail is sweet and fruity!
3624|Pineapple Hair|This hair isn't made of pineapple, it's just been dyed and jelled to look like pineapple leaves.
3626|Pet Trainer Cap|This hat says PT on it. You can wear it to show you're a Pet Trainer, but you could also use it to celebrate Physical Therapy, or Popcorn Time, or whatever you like!
3628|Silkworm Leash|You wanna take your Silkworm for a walk? Use this on it! Note: The silkworm will become a permanent pet, no longer able to produce silk. Good news: it will also become immortal!
3630|Silkworm Saddle|Use this on your silkworm to saddle up and ride! Note: The silkworm will become a permanent riding item, no longer able to produce silk. Good news: it will also become immortal!

3652|Riding Silkworm - Green|The more legs your ride has, the smoother it is. Too bad centipedes don't grow this big.
3654|Riding Silkworm - Blue|The more legs your ride has, the smoother it is. Too bad centipedes don't grow this big.

3666|Riding Silkworm - Aqua|The more legs your ride has, the smoother it is. Too bad centipedes don't grow this big.
3668|CRISPR Technology|This is not a tasty potato chip. With this cutting-edge genetic technology, you can splice Battle Pets of different elements together! One CRISPR is used up for each cross-element splice you perform.
3670|Genetic Resequencer|Wrench a Battle Pet Cage with a pet inside, and you can use this to resequence their DNA. It will rotate the order of their 3 powers, so that their 1st gene-spliced ability becomes their natural ability, and thus their appearance.
3672|Pet Trainer Medal|Congratulations! You have been awarded a medal for defeating a Pet Trainer!
3674|Whale Block|Whale whale whale, you'll really have to wail on this block to smash it. But you'll have a whale of a time doing it! And what a tail to tell it will be. I'm way ill from all of these puns, I'm gonna start blubbering. ORCA.
3676|Pet Trainer Whistle|You know how to battle a Pet Trainer, right? You just put your lips together, and blow this whistle. You might want to have a fully stocked Battle Leash first though, because Pet Trainers won't stay around waiting to fight you forever!
3678|Thinking Cap|They say two heads are better than one. We can't arrange that, but we can get you two of what's inside your head!
3680|Phlogiston|This fantastic substance contains the very essence of living flame.
3682|Lock-Bot|This robot works for Locke. He'll trade you fabulous items for locks! He'll only stick around in your world for 24 hours before he's needed elsewhere, though.
3684|Lock-Bot Remote|This handy remote will call Lock-Bot to your world at the location you specify. It only works once, so choose wisely! Lock-Bot will leave after 24 hours.
3686|Toy Lock-Bot|It's just like Lock-Bot, only tiny! And he doesn't trade locks, he SHOOTS them.
3688|Burnt Leather|If this was a piece of a pig, you'd call a pork rind. But it's a cow rind. Strong material for crafting!
3690|Buckle Design|This paper details a method for forging a buckle out of Deep Iron. If you forge 100 Deep Iron Ingots with this design in hand, you'll make an Iron Buckle instead of a Pick Blade.
3692|Iron Buckle|This buckle would be good for holding straps together, if you need for such things!
3694|Weather Machine - Heatwave|This amazing new weather machine emits a vortex of howling flame, but if you wrench it, you’ll find adjustable settings to control the color of the flames! You can only have one of these per world.
3696|Riding Phoenix|Whoa, you're really sitting on the ride now. There are only 500 of these in existence, so don't lose yours!

3706|B.O.O. Shirt|The official uniform of the B.O.O. - Battlers of the Otherworldly. Join today!
3708|B.O.O. Pants|The official uniform of the B.O.O. - Battlers of the Otherworldly. Join today!
3710|Spectral Goggles|The spectrally polarized lenses of these goggles allow you to actually see paranormal activity. Be warned: it is very spooky! But it's there whether you can see it or not... wouldn't you rather know?
3712|B.O.O. Helmet|The trouble with poltergeists is that they’re always pushing things off of shelves (side note: cats pose same problem). That’s where the helmet comes in. Protect yourself from falling books and antiques!
3714|Neutron Pack|This backpack contains a portable nuclear reactor. I know that sounds a bit unsafe, but... well, it is. It's a terrible idea. It has blinky lights, though. You'll need to wear a Neutron Pack to power a Neutron Gun.
3716|Neutron Gun|This energy blaster looks impressive, but actually has no impact on our world. Rather, it creates a stream of neutrons that attracts spirits. Ghosts can't escape the beam. Which reminds me: Don't ever cross your beam with somebody else's! That would be bad.
3718|Rubber Boots|These are tight-fitting boots made of a natural rubber that protects from slime while still allowing your feet to breathe.
3720|Ghost Jar|Place this jar down and it will suck in a ghost that's above it. You will probably need some friends with Neutron Guns to keep the ghost contained or it will escape! A jar takes 2 seconds to activate, and then only collects spirits for 5 seconds, so time it carefully.
3722|Ghost-In-A-Jar|Spooky! This jar contains a ghost! You can throw it to break the jar and unleash the ghost, or instead Drop it gently in front of a Spirit Storage Unit where you can keep the ghost for good.
3724|Spirit Storage Unit|This incredible machine was invented a hundred years ago, and still runs on Steam power! Drop Ghosts-In-A-Jar in front of it, then provide it with Steam power to store the ghosts. Warning: If you overload the device, it may explode!
3726|Destroyed Spirit Storage Unit|An SSU that exploded. No good for anything now.
3728|Ectoplasm Sample|This is an important scientific discovery that could change our understanding of life itself! But you know what'd be fun? Throwing it at somebody.
3730|Crystallized Ghost|This ghost underwent some kind of reaction during a Spirit Storage explosion, and now it's been crystallized inside a solid block. Maybe one day scientists will extract its DNA and make a theme park of ghosts. Probably not, since ghosts don't have DNA.
3732|Warning Block|When something is so dangerous there's no time for words, just throw down some yellow and black stripes!
3734|Warning Background|When something is so dangerous there’s no time for words, just thrown down some yellow and black stripes!
3736|Demon Control Cap|With this helmet, which is not a colander at all, you can control a demon dog from another dimension!
3738|Haunted Pants|What's that eerie noise coming from in there? These pants must be haunted!
3740|Root Beer|Ah, a cold frosty mug root beer. The only downside is that all that carbonation is sure to make you burp a tiny bit...
3742|Spray Tan|If you don't want to get cancer from the sun, spray this on your skin to get an ultra-realistic bronze tone! Warning: Causes lots and lots of cancer. Lots.
3744|Shark-Tooth Necklace|I don't know if this is a tooth from every shark you've killed, or each one that's bitten you, but either way it's impressive.
3746|Firefin|This is a 1 lb. Firefin. It’s not too tough to figure out where this fish gets it’s name. During the winter, they stay in warmer waters, but for the week of Summerfest, these can be found in their old spawning grounds right here in Growtopia!
3748|Bone Spikes|Someone has stacked a bunch of bones here and sharpened the ends. I know that's dangerous in itself, but aren't you a little more concerned about exactly who did it and where they are now?
3750|Ghost Charm|When activated (punch to activate), this horrific face terrifies even ghosts, preventing new ghosts from appearing in your world. Ghosts that are already in your world still need to be captured by B.O.O. professionals, however. The poor ghosts are trapped on this earthly plane!
3752|Steam Funnel|The links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. Steam can enter this Funnel from 3 sides, but can only exit from one side. You figure out which!
3754|Steam Funnel - Up|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. Steam can enter this Funnel from 3 sides, but can only exit from one side...
3756|Steam Funnel - Down|This links up to other Steam blocks and conduct steam power. Steam can enter this funnel from 3 sides, but can only exit from one side. You figure out which!
3758|B.O.O. Sign|Advertise your ghost-hunting services with this handy sign! You're a proud member of B.O.O., so let everybody know. Use your wrench to set the message.

3764|Atomic Fireball|For when lava isn't hot enough!
3766|Steam Crossover|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. It's actually 2 unconnected pipes - one runs from left to down, and the other runs from up to right. Use this to keep steam from going places you don't want!
3768|Steam Crank|This links up to other Steam blocks and can conduct steam power. When punched, this pipe rotates between horizontal and vertical. Use your wrench to decide whether to allow the public to adjust it.
3770|Steam Lamp|This crystal lamp is powered by steam! It burns for 10 seconds each time it gets charged. It can only be powered from below. The Steam Code prohibits more than 100 steam-powered items in a world.
3772|Steam Spikes|Steam forces razor-shape spikes from the ground in this dastardly trap! It can only be powered from below. Power it again to lower the spikes.
3774|No-Face|Embarassed? Feel like hiding your face? How about just removing it instead?
3776|Purple Djellaba|This long robe is suitable for male or female Growtopians, provided they want to look snazzy and colorful!
3778|Yellow Djellaba|This long robe is suitable for male or female Growtopians, provided they want to look snazzy and colorful!
3780|Green Djellaba|This long robe is suitable for male or female Growtopians, provided they want to look snazzy and colorful!
3782|Mini Blocks|These blocks are only 1/4 the size of a normal block! To make up for that, they come in sets of four.
3784|Teeny Blocks|These blocks are only 1/4 the size of Mini Blocks! To make up for that, they come in sets of sixteen.
3786|Jigsaw Wallpaper|Well, that was easy... It's a picture of a jigsaw puzzle!
3788|Riding Broomstick|What magic makes this fly? Witch magic makes this fly!
3790|Techno Visor|This is handy technology for people who are overwhelmed with modern life - it blocks one of your ears from hearing things, and one of your eyes from seeing things. Just relax and enjoy the left half of the world
3792|Glowstick|This plastic tube of lethal radioactive elements is the perfect thing to swing around at a party! It also provides light.
3794|Display Shelf|These are some big shelves. Why not display your favorite items on them? They can hold four items to display.
3796|One-Way Block|This block can only be moved through in the direction the arrow is pointing. From the other direction, it might as well be a wall!
3798|VIP Entrance|The fanciest door in town! The only people getting through this door are the ones who are on The List. Wrench the door to add people to The List. Or remove them, if they have offended you in some way.
3800|Rhino Horn|Aw, it thinks you're its mama.
3802|Globe|Add a little class to your office with a globe! You can also wrench it to check the current top worlds.
3804|Challenge Timer|Player can punch this to begin a challenge: get from the Challenge Start Flag to the Challenge End Flag before the time runs out! Wrench the timer to set up your challenge and insert prizes.
3806|Challenge Start Flag|Use this with a Challenge Timer. Wrench it to set an ID, so it knows which Challenge Timer to work with.
3808|Challenge End Flag|Use this with a Challenge Timer. Wrench it to set an ID, so it knows which Challenge Timer to work with.
3810|Fish Wall Mount|Proud of your catch, but you don't want the responsibility of caring for it? Mount it to this wall plaque with your wrench! You can display Perfect or Massive fish on this mount. Once a fish is mounted, it can never be removed.
3812|Octopus Head|This is why aquariums have rules.
3814|Stonefish|This is a 1 lb. Stonefish. This is one of the most poisonous fish in the world! It's also made of rock, which is weird.
3816|Tamago Sushi|Wait, this sushi doesn’t even have fish in it!
3818|Portrait|Any Villain
3820|Orca|This is a 1 lb. Orca. You could put this in a fish tank, but then people would probably make documentaries about you. Not flattering ones.
3822|Red Hair Dye|Pour this gunk on your head if you want your hair to be red! It may require multiple applications to achieve the desired color, or mixing with other dyes. The dye interacts with your natural hair color, so some colors may simply be impossible to achieve.
3824|Green Hair Dye|Pour this gunk on your head if you want your hair to be green! It may require multiple applications to achieve the desired color, or mixing with other dyes. The dye interacts with your natural hair color, so some colors may simply be impossible to achieve.

3836|Honey|The sweet nectar of bee spit! Bees also craft plastic bear shapes to store it in. Nobody knows why.
3838|Sorcerer Stone|There's mystical gem embedded in this rock. Heck, there's probably a few in there. Smash it open and see!
3840|Villain Portrait - The Harvester|Just before knocking him unconscious, you snapped a lovely photo of The Harvester for posterity. Put it up on the wall, show off your achievement!

3866|Harvest Witch Mask|Normally this mask is only worn during the most profane of dark rituals, beneath a blood red moon. But you can wear it for shopping, parties, whatever!
3868|Harvest Horn|Don't blow this horn. Never blow this horn. It is evil.
3870|Ancestor Mooncake|This pastry is filled with a sweet bean paste. An image of your ancestor is imprinted on the top in ancient Growtopian script. Mix this with other Mooncakes in a Laboratory or E-Z Cook Oven to create special Harvest Festival items.

3894|Harvest Robinsons|These special edition Air Robinsons are themed to celebrate the harvest, or just to be bright crazy colors, like all basketball shoes.

3898|Telephone|It's a phone! Dial it with your wrench. Growtopia doesn't have any cell service, so you're stuck with this old thing.
3900|Wooden Sword|They use these to train in Kendo. They won't cut much, but getting whacked with one certainly does hurt!
3902|Crazy Jim|Not a real item, just for an icon in the telephone screen.
3904|Code Block: Kappa|This block looks like a mysterious computronic data reference. But that's just for fun, i'm sure. I mean, this is just a game... isn't it?

3916|Illuminati Stone|Finally, the 100% undeniable proof! You have DISCOVERED THE TRUTH!

3932|Rock Hammer|A precision instrument for chipping fossils out of rocks. If you find a fossil, equip this hammer and start tapping, - but do it *carefully!* If the fossil comes loose and you hit it again, you'll break it!
3934|Rock Chisel|So you've extracted a fossil from a rock, but the rock is still in your way. That's where the chisel comes in! It lets you chip away the rock without damaging the fossil.
3936|Fossil|A corpse from millions of years ago, turned to stone. It's still covered with a lot of stone, so we're not sure what it is just yet. Try cleaning it off in a Fossil Prep Station.
3938|Fossil Prep Station|Put a fossil in this tank where special solvents and bacterial agents will slowly dissolve any remaining rock and reveal exactly what you've found. The time required varies anywhere from an hour to a day depending on how much needs dissolving. The light turns green when it's ready, so punch to collect!
3940|Ammonite Block|A huge beautiful ammonite fossil has been extracted! It'd make a lovely coffee table.
3942|Dino Ribcage|It's a bit grisly, but these enormous bones make kind of a fun set of monkey bars.

3948|Amber Block|This ancient tree sap has hardened into a beautiful crystal. Who knows, there might even be a mosquito inside holding dinosaur DNA! That's pretty standard for amber.
3950|T-Rex Skull|This would make an impressive display in your museum! Even more impressive in your haunted house.
3952|Red Pet Pteranodon|You've brought a dinosaur back to life with genetic engineering! There's no way that this could go badly!

4080|DNA Processor|This advanced device from Growtech can take in strands of ancient DNA and combine them to create real living creatures. It has terrifying ethical implications.
4082|Dino DNA Strand A-273|This is a strand of prehistoric DNA. All we know for sure is it comes from a dinosaur. Perhaps there's a way to recombine it and bring them back! That doesn't seem like a terrible idea at all.
4084|Dino DNA Strand C-904|This is a strand of prehistoric DNA. All we know for sure is it comes from a dinosaur. Perhaps there’s a way to recombine it and bring them back! That doesn’t seem like a terrible idea at all.

4090|Plant DNA Strand X-277|This is a strand of prehistoric DNA. All we know for sure is it comes from a plant. Perhaps there's a way to recombine it and bring them back! That actually sounds pretty safe, since it's a plant.
4092|Plant DNA Strand Y-985|This is a strand of prehistoric DNA. All we know for sure is it comes from a plant. Perhaps there's a way to recombine it and bring them back! That actually sounds pretty safe, since it's a plant.
4094|Prehistoric Flowering Fern|Welcome... to Jurassic Botanical Garden.
4096|Prehistoric Red Fern|It's sad to think where this grows.
4098|Prehistoric Fern|Nature always finds a way.
4100|Purple Devourer Plant|This is what happens when you give a prehistoric flower a taste for magic bacon!
4102|Blue Devourer Plant|This is what happens when you give a prehistoric flower a taste for magic bacon!
4104|Prehistoric Vines|You can hide from rampaging dinosaurs in these vines.
4106|Prehistoric Candy Vines|You can try to hide from rampaging dinosaurs in these vines, but you'll probably get eaten because the vines themselves taste like candy.
4108|Seussian Tree|These particular trees, near the Jirassic seas, produced quite a crunchety fruit. Though scientists say that it tasted okay, we can't pollinate so it's moot.

4112|Blue Riding Raptor|I know, they're supposed to have feathers and stuff nowadays... Well, this is an old-school raptor!

4124|DNA Extractor|This experimental device can extract prehistoric DNA from objects which contain even small traces. To give it a try, just use an item on it and see what you find! This is very new technology, so results are unpredictable, and rarely successful.
4126|Stone Spear|In ancient times, sticks and stones were about as good as it got. The upside is it's a magic stone - this spear will teleport back into your hand once thrown!
4128|Blue Hardhat|Head protection is required in construction areas, and at some dig sites.
4130|Outback Hat|G'day! Barbie! Shrimp! That's not a knife, it's a hat! These hats are popular among paleontologists and other desert dwellers.
4132|Fossil Brush|You can use this to gently brush a fossil before you pick it up, improving its quality. A Fossil Brush will be destroyed upon use (fossils are very rough until you brush them!). If you pick up a fossil, your finger oils will make a Fossil Brush useless, so be sure you brush before collecting!
4134|Polished Fossil|This fossil has been carefully polished, so it's sure to yield something good when run through a Fossil Prep Station!
4136|Heatbow|This bow shoots flaming arrows!
4138|Doompunk Corset|Internal organs rotted away? The corset should fit you fine!

4142|Doompunk Top Hat|Keep an extra pair of goggles up there. You never know when you'll need them for evil.

4146|Doompunk Leggings|Works equally well for a doompunk or a pirate! Or maybe a serial killer from the 80's
4148|Doompunk Trenchcoat|Keep warm while stalking people on those frosty London evenings in this stylish piece of Grow Couture! Note: this is a "chest item", like a necklace so you can wear any shirts and back items you want underneath it.
4150|Eye Of Growganoth|This accursed necklace binds one of the eternal and innumerable Eyes of Growganoth to your service. Just make sure you don’t take “your” eye of it - at the first sign of weakness, it will devour your soul!
4152|Apocalypse Steed|The four horsemen have updated to more modern steeds. They're probably gonna be pretty mad when they find out you have swiped one.
4154|Jack o' Lantern Mask|Luckily this is just latex and not actually a gooey carves-out pumpkin.
4156|Devil Tail|Why you little devil...
4158|Buzzsaw|This is how your shop teacher lost those fingers.

4172|Demonic Skull|Just the thing for showing your appreciation of the darker musicks.
4174|Death Metal Block|Throw up the horns! METAL!!!!!
4176|Steel Spike|Hey, these things have a million uses! I can’t think of any right now, but they totally do. Just don’t leave them inside surgical patients, please.

4180|Spiked Collar|Ah yeah, you look tough, like a junkyard dog.
4182|Malevolent Hair|What are you up to under that mop-top? Seems like something a little sneaky..
4184|Riding Raven|Only dark magic could breed a raven so massive. It`s so powerful it allows you to double-jump!

4188|Haunted Window|It’s so dark in here, only the window provides any relief! Players can only see what’s on this tile if it’s in their line of sight, or they have special tools.

4202|Decorative Roof Dragon|Just for looks. Make your pagoda roofs spikey with dragons! Not so spikey they hurt, though.
4204|Grand Jade Platform|Something stylish to stand on. Try decorating it with Decorative Roof Dragons!
4206|Stone Pagoda Base|This is a special piece - it looks like the bottom row of a Stone Pagoda, and it even tiles properly with Stone Pagoda blocks. The trick is, it won't tile with the ones below it. Use it to put a roof in the middle of your pagoda! Kind of a key feature of pagodas, right? It will also tile with Decorative Roof Dragons.
4208|Demonic Horns|MAHHTIN looks like Tim Curry.
4210|Master Peng|Master Peng runs The Grand Tournament. Don't mess with him. But punching is how he likes to be greeted, so one punch is cool.
4212|Tourney Token|Your reward for victory in The Grand Tournament. Put it in the Prize Ladder to win fabulous prizes!

4230|Ramune|This fizzy lemon-lime drink is sure to result in some major burps.
4232|Pow Stones|This carbonated candy crackles and pops in your mouth. Don't worry, it's probably not made from real rocks. Warning: DO NOT COMBINE WITH SODA. Super duper true urban legends verify that this is dangerous.
4234|Extractium Ore|This mysterious element has strange properties which seem to make DNA extraction more successful!
4236|Extractium Shard|This mysterious element seems to be present in small quantities in ancient fossils. Maybe you can combine these shards into a piece large enough to have a measurable effect on something!

4246|Minor Otherworldly Bait|This is bait for fishing. Equip a fishing rod and then use this bait on water that you are standing next to in order to start fishing.

4328|Plague Doctor Hat|Rumpled and trumpy, really showing your dedication to your craft.

4334|Spare Body Part|Oh, nobody's even gonna notice this is missing, I'm sure. They had at least two of these when they came in.

6058|Dual Six-Shooters|Did you shoot 11 bullets... or 12? Trick question: These guns never run out! Sure, NONE of Growtopia's guns ever run out, but these come loaded with extra grit and vigor! Yahoo!
6060|Dark Spirit Board|Able to commune with dark and devastating powers from beyond the veil, this board can rip answers from the other side in the hands of a talented medium! Requires 5 brave Growtopians to stand in a circle around the board in order to properly contact the Realms Beyond. Only the owner of a world can place this board for safety reasons. WARNING: Using this means meddling with incredibly strong powers that can damage - and may destroy - worlds! Be careful where you use it. Your bedroom may not be the best idea!
6062|Spirit Board|Tired of paying overpriced mediums and fortune tellers to chat up the dead? Don't throw your money away! Invest in a Spirit Board and start contacting ghosts on your own! It's like a seance in a box!

6082|Ghost Trap|Snags spirits in a snap! Place this trap down and it'll suck in a ghost that's above it. The Ghost Trap generates an enhanced field that is larger than a ghost jar, but you'll probably still need some friends with Neutron Guns to keep the ghost contained or it will escape! A trap takes 2 seconds to activate, and then only collects spirits for 5 seconds, so time it carefully!
